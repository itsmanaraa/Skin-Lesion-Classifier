# Skin Lesion Classifier

AI-powered skin lesion detection and classification using deep learning (ResNet18).

## About

This application uses a ResNet18 model trained on the HAM10000 dataset to classify skin lesions into 7 categories:
- **AKIEC** - Actinic Keratoses (Precancerous)
- **BCC** - Basal Cell Carcinoma (Malignant)
- **BKL** - Benign Keratosis (Benign)
- **DF** - Dermatofibroma (Benign)
- **MEL** - Melanoma (Malignant - Critical)
- **NV** - Melanocytic Nevi (Benign)
- **VASC** - Vascular Lesions (Benign)

## Features
